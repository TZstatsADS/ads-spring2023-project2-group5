+ **Project summary**: This R Shiny application visualizes the number of sent business permit applications and how successful they were over time since 2014, separated by borough. To see how different sectors were affected, businesses are separated into 4 categories: Services and Business, Entertainment, Retail, and Transportation. This app highlights the specific socioeconomic impacts COVID-19 had from the perspective of business owners and its patrons. All data is drawn from NYC Open Data.

**[Here](https://zhanghaoyu0.shinyapps.io/Stats5243/)** is our app.

+ **Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) 
In this project, we mainly focused on explored the the relationship between the COVID-19 and the Business Applications. All six of us contributed equally in the project. We started a Google Colab and work on the code together.

At the beginning, we all find datasets on our own, and we scheduled zoom meetings to determine which to be used. After determining the datasets, we all work on exploring the dataset and see if there is anything related, and we met on Zoom again to determine the topic of this project. At the meantime, we always communicated findings of the datasets on WhatsApp.
Later, we splitter the 6 people group into two teams: (Mingze Xu, Hong Ouyang, and Haoyu Zhang) worked on the datasets and work on the EDA, while (Luke Arceneaux, Fei Xue, and Ranran Tao) worked on the skeleton structure of the Shiny APP. Even though we might work on different things, we always shared opinions and asked for revisions. After we had a general idea about the entire project, we met on Zoom and work on the code together. 

Overall, we all have equal contributions to the entire project.
