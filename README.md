![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: This R Shiny application utilizes NYC business permit application data from NYC Open Data. It visualizes the number of sent applications and how successful they were over time since 2014, separated by borough. In order to see how different sectors were affected, we also separated the businesses into 4 categories: Services and Business, Entertainment, Retail, and Transportation. 

This app highlights the specific socioeconomic impacts COVID-19 had from the perspective of business owners and its patrons.
