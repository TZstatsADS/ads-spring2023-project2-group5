+ **Project summary**: This R Shiny application visualizes the number of sent applications and how successful they were over time since 2014, separated by borough. To see how different sectors were affected, businesses are separated into 4 categories: Services and Business, Entertainment, Retail, and Transportation. This app highlights the specific socioeconomic impacts COVID-19 had from the perspective of business owners and its patrons. All data is drawn from NYC Open Data.
